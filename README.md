# IRC Bot

Here is an IRC Bot. Maybe in the future I'll have a collection of bots that can do different objectives. But for now, there is only TrollBot.

## Requirements

You must either have this installed, or cloned in the same directory as IRC Bot

    https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc

You must also have NodeJS installed

    http://nodejs.org/

## How To Run

First, edit the bot config for the channel and IRC server you want it to run on in the code, then in terminal type:

    node bot.js
